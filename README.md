## :rocket: Introduction

    Whatever your opinions might be, this is a chocolatine.

    But what purpose does it serve? It allows you to go through the day and through
    your work better.
    In other words, it facilitate your work and allows you to focus on things that
    matter (discussing its name does not pertain to this category).
    Your repositories are hosted on GitHub, and GitHub has an intuitive way of
    automating the launch of predefined actions, triggered by events of your choice.
    It is, in the same way as chocolatines, a great way to facilitate and enhance
    your development and your workflow.

    In this project, you will setup a GitHub Actions workflow to enforce good
    practices and diverse rules in a repository.
